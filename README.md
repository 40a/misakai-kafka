Misakai.Kafka
=============

High-Performance C# client for Apache Kafka. This client was designed not to support all possibile features, but to serve as a minimalistic and lightweight Kafka client for long-running producers/consumers. The code was based on James Roland's KafkaNet implementation, trimmed down and optimized significantly.

var client = new Producer(router);

Task.Run(() =>
{
    var consumer = new Consumer(new ConsumerOptions("latencies", router));
    foreach (var data in consumer.Consume())
